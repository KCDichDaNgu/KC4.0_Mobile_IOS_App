BOKI began to realize that she really is a banana and they had a great time together. BOKI began to think that this dream was unlike any other because he was actually talking to a girl and they spent an amazing time together. Banana’s image remained in BOKi’s mind, Banana liked chewing gums and she had dazzling eyes, BOKI was totally in love and a bit sad because she only existed in her dreams. The following night, Boo more than ever slept early to spend more time with Banana and this night, he decided to also become a banana in the world of plants. Banana was shocked seeing him as a banana because she was expecting the cute mushroom that she met but then again, they had a great time together, they sat down and as Banana was lying on BOKI’s shoulder they had a conversation that totally changed their lives Banana: “What’s your world like?” BOKI: “You would hate it there, full of cruel people and not as peaceful as your world” Banana: “But you know what, I’m sure I’d love it there” BOKI: “What makes you so sure, you’ve never been there” Banana: “Well, I’m sure I’d love it there because at least you’d be there, we’d be together, it gets lonely here without you. BOKI: “If only there’s a way for us to be together all the time” Banana: “Believe me when I say that I would do anything just to make it happen” BOKI'S DREAMS" Chapter 2 Boo continued to be caught up in is dreams, thinking that only in his dreams can he be anything and only in his dreams, people are nice and the world is peaceful. So, he was always looking forward to sleeping and to escape the reality of this world in his dreams. He would always decide what he would look like in his dreams. One night he was a glowing boy up in the sky, shining with the stars and he saw a spaceship. So, he decided that he would be an astronaut the other night to explore more of the world up there, he saw how the earth shines up there so he wanted an explanation for that. The next night, he wanted to dig dip into science so he became a monkey scientist. Upon exploring science, he became curious of the past and how it all began. So, the next night he went to back to the past when people wear the bushes and leaves, he didn’t like his costume. The next night he went back to the past but in a different costume, he was more of a time traveler from the future wearing formal clothes with googles. The next night, BOKI was so tired with school that he immediately fell asleep, so he was not able to decide what he would be in his dreams. So, that night he became a cool boy with white hoodie, a broken egg in his head and a talking frog in his shoulders, it was weird but he still continued to stroll around. The next day, BOKI started to ran out of ideas on what he wanted to become in his dreams. While he was sitting in the bench of their school garden, he saw a sculpture of gnome and beside it grew a mushroom, which he thought to be cute so the next night, he wanted to be a cute little mushroom in a world of plants, he enjoyed the place and he met a girl named banana, “HI! I’m Banana”, the girl said. “Hello banana, I’m BOKI, I like your costume” he answered, BOKI began to realize that she really is a banana and they had a great time together.
